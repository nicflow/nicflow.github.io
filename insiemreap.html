					<h5>Bye Bye, Beijing, I'm Bangkok Bound!</h5>
					
					<p>Today I woke up early to pack up and take a walk to the Forbidden City to see the grounds and check out the square in the daylight before my afternoon flight.</p>					
					
					<p>The palace grounds were magnificent and of course, expansive. For those wondering, as I was, the name "Forbidden City" comes from the days when the emperor lived within the compound and no one from his constituency was allowed inside; it was a city inside the city. Needless to say you don't come to Beijing and miss this. Duhzies.</p>	

					<p>A quick viewing of Tiananmen made me wonder what it was like those twenty something years ago when martial law and machine gun tanks took out hundreds of people and the last vocal uprising China's people dared in the hopes of freedom and democracy. I found it fair cause to be thankful for what I have, which is everything, and those who fight for my freedom to speak out about anything I desire (yep, that's you, Matt!). It's always nice to have brief reminders that there's no place like home, there's no place like America.</p>	

					<p>Well, after a bit of a runaround, thankfully Air China came through for me again and got me on an earlier flight to get me into Bangkok for dinner. This is extremely important as I have a real hot date there tonight...</p>
