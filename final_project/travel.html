				<p>Along with my family and dear friends, there are a few things I hold dear to my heart: traveling, reading, and food. Oh! And Airbnb. It's random but God's honest truth. Up until now, I've made it to all 50 states and just shy of 40 countries (ok! 39 to be exact). I've trekked Machu Picchu and climbed Kilimanjaro and make sure to head out of the country at least twice a year. I travel to not only see the world differently but to see <em>my</em> world differently and find myself always changing and learning after an experience abroad. Whether with children in on orphanage in Honduras or climbing the steep slopes of the Faroes, life is richer when I bolt out of my comfort zone and into the unexpected.</p>
