				<h1>Hi there! I'm Nicole.</h1>
			</section>

			<h5>I like to call myself a perpetual wanderer whose main goal is to love people well so they might love others better.</h5>

			<section class="about">
				<p>True confession, though? I sure do the first part well but not so much the latter and I'm consciously thankful for new days where I can try again.</p>

				<img src="images/about/handout.jpg">

				<p>In 2011 I started a small fanny pack company called <a href="www.hiipSF.com">hiip</a> and through our sales get the pleasure of hanging out sometimes with my homeless neighbors of San Francisco. My goal in founding the company was to bring together two seemingly different groups of people: those who "have" and those who "have less." I wanted to facilitate a sense of belonging in my own neighborhood, on my own streets. There is so much beauty to be found in our urban cities if we stop to look around us but moreso if we stop to look <em>at those</em> around us. </p>

				<p>Along with my family and dear friends, there are a few things I hold dear to my heart: traveling, reading, and food. Oh! And Airbnb. It's random but God's honest truth. Up until now, I've made it to all 50 states and just shy of 40 countries (ok! 39 to be exact). I've trekked Machu Picchu and climbed Kilimanjaro and make sure to head out of the country at least twice a year. I travel to not only see the world differently but to see <em>my</em> world differently and find myself always changing and learning after an experience abroad. Whether with children in on orphanage in Honduras or climbing the steep slopes of the Faroes, life is richer when I bolt out of my comfort zone and into the unexpected.</p>
				
				<p>As far as reading goes, I logged 82 books last year alone (mostly by listening at 2x while I was driving or cleaning my apartment). Admittedly, this is an embarassing statistic. My goal for 2017 is a simple 24 books (one for each month for both of my book clubs... who's the coolest?!) as I've opted to learn Italian! This comes after living in Florence 15 years ago so my exceling at procrastination is not lost on me. My food claim to fame is finishing 7x7's Big Eat every year since 2009. If you can imagine it, I eat even more than I read.</p>

				<p>Anyway, I'm just glad and honored you stopped by. I hope you can stay awhile and find nourishment for your soul and laughter for your pocket.</p>
