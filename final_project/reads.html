					<h1>Hi there! I'm Nicole.</h1>
				</section>

				<h4>I like to call myself a perpetual wanderer whose main goal is to love people well so they might love others better.</h4>

				<section class="about">
					<p>True confession, though? I sure do the first part well but not so much the latter and I'm consciously thankful for new days where I can try again.</p>

					<p>I love goals, checklists, people, and travel. Each of those items fuels another. My passion for people has not only led me to find out more about places much different than my home of San Francisco (I've made it to all 50 states and just shy of 40 countries due to some goals and checklists) but pressed me to spend the last few years building partnerships in the social entrepreneurship space.</p>
