					<h5>Houston, we have arrived!</h5>

					<p>Is that even a famous movie line? Anyway, I've used it now, haven't I? Haven't I.</p>

					<p>Where it's 4.30a at home, it's only a mere 9.30p on this side of the... the water? Is only the Atlantic "The Pond"? I think I'll look into that sometime... But who am I kidding? I'll completely forget. Needless to say, I have arrived here safely and soundly. After an on time arrival and an uneventful immigration passing, I made it to the outer Tokyo train lines in one piece.</p>

					<p>What. A. Nightmare. First of all, did anyone else know they don't speak English here?! I mean their characters look nowhere near how ours do. Isn't our language, like, world renown? Didn't we win the world-wide language battle with those silly French? Where is the translation? Where are my words below your words?!</p>	
					
					<p>I'll tell you where, nowhere. The only saving grace (and I truly mean saving grace, Touched By An Angel style) was little, 50-something-year-old Mei who spotted me as we were leaving customs. She asked if I knew where I was going and, as I looked around at the lack of a familiar font, I pitifully responded with a whispered, "no", a shoulder shrug, and something akin to a distorted pout.</p>
					
					<p>Mei, it so happens, is from Berkeley and she now lives right in this here city of Tokyo. Mei changed my money with her own cash and took me from Narita directly to my stop in Shibuya (shiBOOya). Homegirl dragged us, luggage and all, to multiple connections and train lines and it left me mortified at the idea that I was to do the whole process alone had she not come to Mighty Mouse me. (look it up)</p>
					
					<p>It took me three hours to get to my hotel. And Mei hit many superlatives for me on our devastatingly long journey that I thought would never end. Mei has to be the cheapest talker I have ever met. Not only did she talk my head off for two full hours, she filled the time-space lapse between her lips and my ears with tips on how to save money EVERYwhere. And we're talking 30 cents. Mmmmhhhmmm 30. Cents. She never takes the bus because it can cost about $10 to $20 more each way, each trip. I estimate that Mei spends an extra three hours every journey trying to save between 30 cents and $20. Thankfully, I now truly believe I have the resources to do the same. If Mei left me with nothing else, she left me aware of how to save $5 at the Kyoto station, gain two hours at the Kyoto station, and that she has every degree known to man. We bid adieu and that was that for generous, kind, and chatty Mei.</p>
					
					<p>After a patience-testing experience including multiple street corners that ALL resemble Times Square, my suitcase going up (and down) four sets of at least 20 stairs, and three wrong turns, I got here... to the Shibuya Granbell Hotel. It is perfect. Thank you, Lauren (who you'll get to meet in Sydney!), for recommending this place. It's wonderful, all six by eight room feet of it. I can hardly fit between desk and bed but this place has a heated toilet and I love my heated toilets! So posh. I may sleep on it tonight...</p>

					<h5>So THIS is life? Looks good...</h5>

					<p>It's two days before I leave on this trip of a lifetime. Now, this seems to be what everyone says to me: "You're going to LIVE in ITALY?! Wow, trip of a lifetime, huh?" or (with extended pauses between words) "Kilimanjaro. What an amazing experience. That will be... the trip of a lifetime. No question." No one really referenced it when I moved to New York and DC, but both were equally, if differently, life changing. "Dubai! Dubai?! I have ALWAYS wanted to go to Dubai." (to which I always wonder a simple and confused, "why?") "Dubai will be the trip of a lifetime!" So matter of fact they all are; so fueled with hope and requests to see pictures. "Don't forget to send me pictures!"</p>

					<p>The thing is, from my first trip out of the US with my best friend at 16 (to Romania to work with street kids and orphanages... I guess I have a heart thing for both) to when I worked with Word Made Flesh in Peru five years ago to when Zoe, my niece, was born last year - all have been trips of a lifetime. Actually, they've been trips of lifetimes. I mean, this is what life itself is made of, don't you think? Dinner with your husband, trips to Borneo to meet up with college friends, babies, the Annapurna Circuit in summer, breakups, milkshakes, late night snacks, impromptu dates, him, Dolores Park on Sunday, Saturday, pillows, singing in the shower (or car or kitchen), bike rides, cooking on the patio, rain, Paris, dogs in the ocean, moms, surfing, her... life.</p>

					<p>When you travel, you change; from experience we can all agree. It can be a moment or a scene, a week or a year, a person or a sight. Whatever it is, I'm always better because I've taught myself (and it's been a difficult, comfort-negating exercise) to "Throw off the bowlines... Explore. Dream. Discover." But when you live life, just every day, pain-inducing, stress-relieving, beautiful, awful, crazy, tragic life you change. Slowly I'm coming to understand that some things can't replace a nervous car ride that you don't want to end or the newness of my Zoe's high-pitched laughter. Because, as I stand here as a newly minted 30 year old, I've realized that this is my trip, my life, my lifetime.</p>

					<p>These are the days; they are all around us. So yes, this will perhaps be my trip of a lifetime... or simply my trip of the year. But so will be Zoe's first steps, the first time you ask me out to tea, when I say I do, when Kristi says I do... and I can't wait for all of it. Joy comes in all sizes as do tears, both they say are better shared - one for the multiplying and one for the cutting, respectively.</p>

					<p>So join me on this journey. I'm so glad you've come along for the ride. Life is about to happen and these are the days for it to happen in...</p>

					<h5>Impromptu eats, late night visits, and the wake up call</h5>

					<p>This weekend was so great. So great. (insert shrugged shoulders and a double-handed air swipe here) From a nighttime nibble in the 'hood on Friday with Mike to a sunny (and most lovely) Sunday brunch in Dogpatch, an outing to the Jordanian consulate and a walk up these holy terror hills of San Francisco with Brooke and Ally, I am ready to go. I saw so many friends this weekend to say goodbye... and it was lovely. I will miss you all so dearly. I feel like I'm some sort of Napoleon-type character penning my final farewell speech. Nope, not sure why I picked him out of the lineup...</p>

					<p>Sunday night was by far the best, though, as I said goodbye to brother and sister and baby Zoe, Mom and Grandma. I was doused with goodies for my flight and for my all-around upkeep these next few weeks. We laughed. We laughed and laughed. I cried a little a dinner, so did Gran. She always gets so worried about me when I leave, I feel the same about her but never quite let her know because it will only get her worrying more. My only hope, along with my safe arrival home, is that she will be here to greet me when I walk through the door. We toasted to good things that boost me into this adventure and to good things that will happen along the way. I felt blessed... probably because I am. I got home to finish packing - a chore that I do not take lightly (as you can see). I'm very determined when it comes to clothes on a daily basis; in my mind, trips should be no different.</p>

					<p>And now, the countdown is on! Airport run in a half hour... I woke up ready and energized. I can't wait for this grand adventure. It will be over before I know it and I can't wait to see who I've become on the other side...</p>
