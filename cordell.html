	<p>And it's pretty long. What can I say? You know I'm a talker. The good news is, I say it better as a writer.</p>
																	    
	<p>I was thinking yesterday about how this guy was once an hour late to meet me and I had to text him later to tell him how I hoped he would, in the future, provide women the respect they deserved by showing up on time. I mean #feminism and all. So, you can imagine how if I have some remaining things to say to someone, I'm going to go ahead and say them. </p>
	
	<p>First things first, I don't know if you'll ever get this. I know you hate emails and who can say this won't go to Spam?! Maybe. And then they'll just be words I typed one time. Second, I don't expect you to respond. You have said all you need to say and I respect that. As I processed our time together and our conversation Saturday, however, I realized there were so many things I had left to tell you! They stem from you saying how we don't make each other better. While it may be true I haven't done much to encourage you over the last two months, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you plainly what you have done for me. </p>
	
	<p>I am right a lot of the time. Or, at least I think I am. I don't think you'd agree. (Offensive!) And I remember saying to Candace last Sunday, "He holds a mirror up to me." and honestly, I think it's one of the most beautiful parts of the last few weeks. It's beautiful and painful in equal measure, you know? Because ugh. Gross. A mirror to not being right. All day Sunday I wanted to talk to you about our talk at breakfast Saturday AND our conversation over the fire pit that night but I didn't sooooo....</p>
	
	<p>It's a couple of things: I didn't apologize to you, and I need to, for the way I spoke to you while we were on our road trip in Joshua Tree. And hush, I know you do not care nor have you waited for it but allow me this gesture! I was rude, prideful, and very elitist in that conversation. And, as you said last week, the tables have turned. Humble pie! But even if they hadn't, my selfish view was offensive, ignorant, and small-minded. And I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me for it. It came from pride and long-held assumptions, not my heart. I also hope you'll forgive my behavior in Wisconsin (and on THE BOAT for heaven's ultimate sake)... even though we've talked about what was going on at that time. I was embarrassed when we talked about it but I should never have allowed it to affect our night the way I did.</p>
	
	<p>Re: our conversation about your brother and the things happening there. Over the past week I've felt really compelled and convicted to apologize for not being as kind and understanding as I could've - and should've - been. What Caylen is going through, I went through years ago and to act like it's a weakness or invalid is hypocritical. Cordell, WTF I was such a jerk. I knew in the moment I should've handled the conversation with more respect and curiosity (because ultimately I felt both!). I respect so much how you are available for your family and I would, as you asked, do the same for mine. I understand, too, you wanting to be near your brother to share life with him and his family. I know he's your best friend. I lived away from my family (outside of college) only a year and as soon as my brother got engaged and I had to take the call in my Manhattan apartment, I flew home (well, I mean there were months in between but for dramatic effect I'll posture it was immediate). Please forgive me for the ways I spoke to you like your experience wasn't valid or "normal" (for whatever that word is worth). Please forgive me for being so prideful and disconnected. Gosh. I am so sorry. I wish I told you sometime Saturday. I wish I told you sometime Sunday. I wish I realized we could still have fun and talk about these types of things before now. </p>
	
	<p>On voting. Maybe my mom is to blame for my lack of knowledge surrounding my blackness. Maybe it's my dad. Maybe it's me for not doing the work more than 4-5 years ago. Whatever the case, I'm catching up and I'm in the conversation now. And you helped me think critically about why I speak, act, and vote the way I do. Your desire to speak on behalf of Black people (your family most importantly) is one of the things I found most admirable about you. You gave me the runway to have deeper conversations with friends and highlight the ways my head was not aligned with my heart. Thank you for that. You made me better even though it's super uncomfortable and it's not my normal. This is where I'll be saddest most. I was learning so much from hearing and watching you, because I still have a long way to go, and I wish I could continue to do so.</p>
	
	<p>I know I was riddled with confusing insecurities over the past seven or so weeks and it's something I'm praying through and will be consequently angry with myself about for a long time coming. This showed up in the ways I brought up conversations, silenced you out, and just overall approached our situation. In my seemingly constant expectation, I dampened our fun. I know timing is huge in any relationship - friendship or otherwise - and I can see how pressure with hiip (and it being my only main focus) was tough for me and led me to expect so much more from you. I wish we could have our first week back. It was easy and real and I think it highlighted so much promise. But life, right? </p>
	
	<p>But in the in between of then and now, you made me better in so many ways. You are not always right and you are a bear to communicate with sometimes... but you made me better. I am better because of your mirror. I am better because of your social involvement. I am better because of you.</p>
	
	<p>You humbled me, you strengthened me, and you gave me courage to finally be the race car driver I have always always always wanted to be! As soon as I get a job and I'm rich again (meaning, I have some sort of money), I'm going to sign up for drifting school and not only achieve my dream of being good at driving fast but also being one of the only women on the track so help me God. You did that. You gave me the push I needed to go chase a dream... and so often I can do that all on my own. I appreciate you.</p>
	
	<p>Cordell Pringle. I hope I get to see you again soon. I hope you will one day believe me that I backpack (and even have my own stove!) and love animals and though I get red in the face listening to WAP, I still love a good beat. And maybe I'll never understand the need to own an AR-15 (or whatever it is, don't split hairs!) but I will always love to shoot. AND CARS. I mean, I'm not going to star in Fast and Furious 29 but I'm going to find myself a little bit to zoom around in and go faster than my (very responsibly purchased) Crosstrek. </p>
	
	<p>I missed our conversation tonight... and yesterday's. I'll miss tomorrow's too. While you're not talking to me for the rest of your life, would you PLEASE READ Small, Great Things. I am not kidding. I'm still begging you. Trust me in this. Read that book.</p>
