			<p>Nicole Flowers was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a lover of both fashion and people from a young age, it seems inevitable that she would find herself merging the two in her home city. During an eight-year tenure in the corporate world, Nicole realized that not only did she want to do more for those around her but she wanted to do it in a way no one else had yet thought of.</p>
			
			<ul>Here on this space, you'll find thoughts about:
				<li>wanderings + travel</li>
				<li>books</li>
				<li>general musings</li>
				<li>food, food, and more food around San Francisco + the globe</li>
			</ul>
