          				<h2>A Random Thought</h2>
						
					<p>I have never felt so interesting in my life as I do in the Middle East thus far. From wondering where I'm from to trying to speak Arabic to me, it's like I'm the new kid in school and everyone wants to play with my hair. Honestly? I love it... :)</p>

				<hr>	
					<h2>The Dead Sea via Amman</h2>
					
					<p>One thing I would add onto our trip would be a day to see the city of Amman. We were in and out of Jordan's capital so quickly that we didn't even get to see the city center proper.</p>

					<p>If you have the time, drop in for dinner and then spend a day exploring the surrounding history. Just a thought!</p>

				<hr>	
					<h2>Amman Beach</h2>
					
					<p>No trip to this area is complete without a stop at the Dead Sea and if you are visiting on the Jordan side for the day and not staying in one of the many resort hotels, plan to stop off here to enjoy an afternoon at the beach</p> 

					<p>We loved the space (though not great for laying out, they do provide salty chairs), the amazing water, and the people. We even wore our bikinis in comfort with other guests; don't be surprised if you see other ladies completely covered, however. Break the day to enjoy lunch as the food is delicious and local and stay for the two swimming pools that include activities for you or the little ones once you're done with the sea salts</p>

					<p>It will prove a relaxing day for all!</p>

					<p>If this isn't on your spa day itinerary, I'm not sure why not. Put it on there!</p>

					<p>Tucked down beneath the mountains and bluffs of central Jordan, Evason Ma'in drops below sea level to offer lively hot springs away from the bustle of the Dead Sea. A day pass costs about $20 (15 Dinar) and you can enjoy ladies', men's, or co-ed dipping pools.</p>

					<p>Head to the main water fall to treat yourself to the rushing currents on your back, steaming pools to massage your muscles, and natural sauna cave to release excess tension.</p>

					<p>It's worth the additional drive away from Amman for the experience as well as the awe inspiring sunset views. It will prove a great closing to your adventurous day...</p>

					<p>Sheryl found this adorable gem via TripAdvisor and it was the perfect spot for us to lay our heads for our two nights in Amman.</p>

					<p>We had a brand new renovated room and found it the perfect blend of contemporary and classic as the major portion of the hotel was slightly dated but our room was super cool! We had a little kitchenette; living room and small dining table; and a great, clean, new room with modern colors and flare. The bathroom was tiny but had a great shower (so nice after a long day in sulphur and salt) and adequate space for two (if needed).</p>

					<p>With breakfast and free wi-fi included, the price and space can't be beat!</p>

					<h5>Highway to the Danger Zone!*</h5>
				
					<p>Our brief stint in the Amman area (but not in Jordan...) was coming quickly to a close (which is sad) but I'm so EXCITED that today we head over the border into Israel. The long day of activity from yesterday encouraged a great night's sleep but the excitement of today's adventure got us to our toes and moving bright and early.</p>

					<p>Once we packed up and rearranged all of our personal affects we ran downstairs two grab some breakfast before heading out. Abu Rashad was ready and waiting so we only had a few minutes to ward off... here he... oh my gosh... and here he is. (Question: does this only happen to me?!) This kid is in full chef paraphernalia with (WITH) his eyes all done up in kohl not unlike an Egyptian queen. I'm aware that this is a Bedouin thing as it protects light eyes from the sun but I'm not sure there is any necessity whatsoever to slap it all over the peepers for a morning INside...</p>

					<p>Whatever. After begrudgingly taking another photo or two, we successfully avoided engaging in extended conversation, checked out, and were out the door before he could find out if we enjoyed our omelets. Ugh. No. I didn't! What with your lurking!</p>

					<p>We drove past some viewpoints that Abu deemed picture worthy and then we were off to the border. I can't tell you what it's like to go alone because he watched over us the entire time as we prepared to leave the country. He arranged our passports, handled the payments, and ensured our bags were taken to the bus and put on in plain sight. Upon seeing that all was as it should be, he wished us well and told us he would be ready and waiting on Sunday morning when we returned to Jordan, just call to let him know what time.</p>

					<p>Then we were off! All settled in and ready to read a bit and write a little, we hunkered down for the hour ride into Israel. Ok. That lasted approximately four minutes. Turns out the bus at the Jordanian border takes you through the literal middle of nowhere where you'll find sand for miles and to the border of Israel. Just right there. No farther. So... Out we go!</p>

					<p>After a few minutes going through security I caught a glimpse of my first yarmulke and I knew that I was in heaven. Know me for a week or two and hopefully you've found out one thing: I love the Jews. Truth! I am enamored  with everything about their culture. The idea that I was getting to finally emerge myself in it? Well, let's just say it didn't help and Sheryl had to hear about it every minute of the day... And yes, I will most definitely be having a Sader again this year.</p>

					<p>No one needed to explain reasons for passport stamping hesitation (with an Israeli stamp you are not allowed into the UAE, Syria, Saudi, etc. but who's caring?) - stamp with vigor! With pride! I'm in Israel! We made it! This was a get for God (and me) as I have wanted to attain what Abu called my Christian Haji. The Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca is called Haji in Arabic and he said that soon, Sheryl and I would have completed ours by following every major spot of our Savior's journey.</p>

					<p>Once on the other side and left to our own devices, we became a little, if not quite, overwhelmed. We had planned to take the bus but were finding the cost was not in positive relation (so economical!) to the time it would take to switch in Jerusalem to get to Tel Aviv, our first stop. Oh, Taha! You had me at "50 extra shekels"! Equalling only about 10 bucks between the two of us, we decided this was the best option for getting into the city by the sea and took our new driver for the next hour and a half up on his offer to take us.</p>

					<p>As we drove along, we saw Jericho, the oldest city in the world and one whose walls were fragile to God's plan and a few good men marching around them seven times back way back when. Remember that? I started singing my Sunday School song and Taha joined right in... We all remember.</p>

					<p>Upon arrival in Tel Aviv we detoured from the hotel to locate an ATM and providentially got a brief tour of our neighborhood and its main street, Rothschild. Once we were settled with Taha, our first order of business was to treat ourselves to some lunch and a walk around the town until our cool artsy room was ready.</p>

					<p>Up, down, and all around we wandered until we settled on Landwer's Coffee Shop. Two major things brought us here: salads and outdoor seating. The day was beautiful and perfect for people watching (do you have any idea how gorgeous these people are?!) and we basked in what would be the only sunshine we'd see in Israel. It was such a delight to relax while we fell instantly and madly in love with this beautiful city that reminded us so much of our own...</p>

					<p>Following a brief rundown of our digs for the next two nights, we took off down to see the sea and snap some shots. As we moved towards the water, we could feel the change in tide as the wind grew faster and rain started falling. Not wanting to get caught in the downpour, we basically sprinted back into the Newe Zedek area to do some covert shopping.</p>

					<p>After tooling around there for a while, we headed (on recommendation) to the Tel Aviv Arts and Crafts Fair that only happens on Tuesdays and Fridays. Thankfully, today was Tuesday! We had a fun time walking throughout the stalls, picking up some things (along with bag loads of gummies), and then finding our way back to Rothschild to grab a drink at the Tel Aviv Brewhouse.</p>

					<p>Though we were going to stop and have dinner there, we weren't too hungry so after the first round we took to the street to find a place to enjoy a nice meal. Both of us were feeling like a little Italian though I was in a mindset that I should have as much lamb as I could get my hands on.</p>

					<p>*Of note: this place is in no way dangerous... but you already knew that. (wink)</p>
