				<section class="about">
					<p>Though cooking is one of my favorite creative outlets, I hardly do it just for me because I'd be eating the same meal for 17 days! The Supper Series, which I began here in 2020 but is a take off a tradition my roommates had in college and then following about 10 years ago before I moved up, is a great way to forge new community as well as practice my culinary (read: follow a recipte) skills.</p>
					
					<p>There are a few things you should know in the event you don't ever make it to my kitchen. First, I always cook to Soft Rock. Yacht Rock, if you will. Specifically, my Christopher Cross Pandora station. To aid you in your culinary pusuits, I've created this dreamy Spotify playlist just for you! Please enjoy Lionel, Phil, and England Dan for days to come.</p>
					
					<p>Second, I do not bake and I don't do breakfast. Sandwiches are my favorite for lunch, well paired with some fruit and veg. I don't like eating lunch items before noon and have a hard time with dinner for lunch (you know what I mean) and therefore, we'll just stick to cooking dinner, whaddaya say?</p>
					
					<p>Anyway, let's get to it! Here are some of my most tried and true recipes. Enjoy!</p>
