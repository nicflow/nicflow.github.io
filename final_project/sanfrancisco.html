					<h5>ohmygoshileaveworktoday | Date: 01/26/2012</h5>

					<p>Today is my last day in the office for six weeks. Hello. Six. Weeks. I know it, Genentech rocks the party that rocks the body. It's true. It's not usual that one gets to take, basically, a summer vacation not unlike that of middle school (and frankly elementary school and college and grad school... I'm looking at you perpetual students) but we do. Every six years we get a six week sabbatical and I've waited, well, six years for this.</p>

					<p>At most I've been away from my desk and my cube buddy Sheryl for two weeks. The good news is that she will be joining me (well, us since you've come along as well!) in Cairo and the Middle East (squeal! I'm so excited for that part). More info on that in some weeks. YAY! The ckpy goes global.</p>

					<p>As I said my goodbyes to my team and my bosses and friends, I realized that I will miss my little room with a view (of the airport and bay, how romantical!) and my team and my bosses and friends. I like it there. I like who's there when I come and when I go. I can't wait to see you when I get back. Let's keep in touch...</p>

					<h5>Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) | Date: 01/27/2012</h5>

					<p>For some reason, this song happened. It was in my head and now it's on my YouTube. For the next four minutes, I'm going to feel free to rock out to it completely and wish I could play the piano. Play it, Elton! Play it while I type...</p>

					<p>So right before I leave on this trip it's our church's monthly outing to go spread some good hope to the peeps of the Tenderloin. This is my favorite thing. If you know me at all - THIS. is. myfavoritething. The fun news? Mark, my big brother, came for the first time! I have to apologize to Fay, Colin, neighbors Matt and Brooke for ditching brunch but combining two things that I adore that much into one? So worth it... so worth it.</p>

					<p>Random plug: If you want more information on any activity like this, please do find me and ask me about it. And then let's do it together...</p>

					<h5>So THIS is life? Looks good... | Date: 01/28/2012</h5>

					<p>It's two days before I leave on this trip of a lifetime. Now, this seems to be what everyone says to me: "You're going to LIVE in ITALY?! Wow, trip of a lifetime, huh?" or (with extended pauses between words) "Kilimanjaro. What an amazing experience. That will be... the trip of a lifetime. No question." No one really referenced it when I moved to New York and DC, but both were equally, if differently, life changing. "Dubai! Dubai?! I have ALWAYS wanted to go to Dubai." (to which I always wonder a simple and confused, "why?") "Dubai will be the trip of a lifetime!" So matter of fact they all are; so fueled with hope and requests to see pictures. "Don't forget to send me pictures!"</p>

					<p>The thing is, from my first trip out of the US with my best friend at 16 (to Romania to work with street kids and orphanages... I guess I have a heart thing for both) to when I worked with Word Made Flesh in Peru five years ago to when Zoe, my niece, was born last year - all have been trips of a lifetime. Actually, they've been trips of lifetimes. I mean, this is what life itself is made of, don't you think? Dinner with your husband, trips to Borneo to meet up with college friends, babies, the Annapurna Circuit in summer, breakups, milkshakes, late night snacks, impromptu dates, him, Dolores Park on Sunday, Saturday, pillows, singing in the shower (or car or kitchen), bike rides, cooking on the patio, rain, Paris, dogs in the ocean, moms, surfing, her... life.</p>

					<p>When you travel, you change; from experience we can all agree. It can be a moment or a scene, a week or a year, a person or a sight. Whatever it is, I'm always better because I've taught myself (and it's been a difficult, comfort-negating exercise) to "Throw off the bowlines... Explore. Dream. Discover." But when you live life, just every day, pain-inducing, stress-relieving, beautiful, awful, crazy, tragic life you change. Slowly I'm coming to understand that some things can't replace a nervous car ride that you don't want to end or the newness of my Zoe's high-pitched laughter. Because, as I stand here as a newly minted 30 year old, I've realized that this is my trip, my life, my lifetime.</p>

					<p>These are the days; they are all around us. So yes, this will perhaps be my trip of a lifetime... or simply my trip of the year. But so will be Zoe's first steps, the first time you ask me out to tea, when I say I do, when Kristi says I do... and I can't wait for all of it. Joy comes in all sizes as do tears, both they say are better shared - one for the multiplying and one for the cutting, respectively.</p>

					<p>So join me on this journey. I'm so glad you've come along for the ride. Life is about to happen and these are the days for it to happen in...</p>

					<h5>Impromptu eats, late night visits, and the wake up call | Date: 01/30/2012</h5>

					<p>This weekend was so great. So great. (insert shrugged shoulders and a double-handed air swipe here) From a nighttime nibble in the 'hood on Friday with Mike to a sunny (and most lovely) Sunday brunch in Dogpatch, an outing to the Jordanian consulate and a walk up these holy terror hills of San Francisco with Brooke and Ally, I am ready to go. I saw so many friends this weekend to say goodbye... and it was lovely. I will miss you all so dearly. I feel like I'm some sort of Napoleon-type character penning my final farewell speech. Nope, not sure why I picked him out of the lineup...</p>

					<p>Sunday night was by far the best, though, as I said goodbye to brother and sister and baby Zoe, Mom and Grandma. I was doused with goodies for my flight and for my all-around upkeep these next few weeks. We laughed. We laughed and laughed. I cried a little a dinner, so did Gran. She always gets so worried about me when I leave, I feel the same about her but never quite let her know because it will only get her worrying more. My only hope, along with my safe arrival home, is that she will be here to greet me when I walk through the door. We toasted to good things that boost me into this adventure and to good things that will happen along the way. I felt blessed... probably because I am. I got home to finish packing - a chore that I do not take lightly (as you can see). I'm very determined when it comes to clothes on a daily basis; in my mind, trips should be no different.</p>

					<p>And now, the countdown is on! Airport run in a half hour... I woke up ready and energized. I can't wait for this grand adventure. It will be over before I know it and I can't wait to see who I've become on the other side...</p>
