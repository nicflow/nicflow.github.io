					<h2>Bangkok SkyTrain (BST) and the Tuk tuk</h2>
					
					<p>On the train? Two words: take it. Once you get yourself upstairs and off the street it becomes so clean! And, since you can't take food or drink on the train, it's not messy either. The SkyTrain hits most major locations throughout the city making transportation fast and easy in a tough situation.</p>

					<p>Taxis, though prevalent in the city, are always metered and the traffic is horrendous. With that in mind, going one mile can end up costing you. Opt for a SkyTrain ride or, if that's not convenient, you MUST get yourself on a tuk tuk. They are so fun and so quick! By far the best rides around… just make sure you’re aware of pricing and directions. (wink)</p>

					<h2>Don't forget!</h2>
					
					<p>When going to religious sites, you'll need your shoulders covered and no knees showing. Jigger wore long shorts and still needed to put pants on. Michelle and I both brought sweaters to ensure we'd be allowed in and also be respectful. It's very hot but very necessary.</p>

					<p>Just a reminder to either dress accordingly or be prepared to rent some more apropos attire.</p>
				<hr>
					<h2>Thai Street Food</h2>
					
					<p>Street food in Thailand is delicious! My recommendation is to go for it if you can see it cooking in front of you. Skewers can be the best to nibble on the go but request that they cook them once more in front of you to ensure they are ready for your belly. The fruit - mangos, pineapple, coconut - are also yummy, fresh treats. Next time you're in the area, don't be shy, pick one up!</p>

					<a href="http://www.bodytune.co.th/Default.aspx" target="_blank"><h2>BODYtune Spa</a></h2>
					
					<p>If you're in the area of the Night Market, this spa is located by Exit 4 of the Prompong BTS station. Though a little pricier than the usual, every-other-door massage place, these girls are certified and it's a safe and clean environment.</p>

					<p>I would say for a foot or hand massage, mani or pedi go next door. For a good Thai massage that you don't want bruises or a broken back from, go to BODYtune. It has never failed Michelle and we loved it!</p>

					<a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bkkal-aloft-bangkok-sukhumvit-11/"  target="_blank"><h2>The Aloft Hotel</a></h2>
					
					<p>Located on one of the hippest streets in Bangkok (says the concierge at Le Meridien), Aloft is a brand new W concept and it's marvelous. If you are looking for down-home Bangkok living, then this isn't the place for you. Outfitted with Westin's iconic bed (Mon, you introduced me to it, remember!? Best Formal Ever.), the room is just like one you'd find in Union Square. There's a lounge with beanbags for when you want a larger TV experience and a 24-hour cafe for when you can't find dinner at midnight. I would actually say it would be great for young people and families as well...</p>

					<p>I was personally glad to feel safe, clean, and fresh. As in radical. No, kidding, I actually would use the word fresh for the hotel. Ha! It's because it's new... and has great prices because of it! The infinity pool was awesome and I all-around enjoyed it. It was a place I could relax and not feel like I wanted to leave.</p>

					<h5>One Night In Bangkok</h5>

					<p>After a week of freezing (LITerally freezing) cold weather, I was delighted to get off the plane in Thailand in 90 degree heat... that is until I realized I was still outfitted for 20. Always the pre-planner, I swapped my boots for my Rainbows and my jeans for shorts and we were ready to go. Sadly I was already, yet again, drenched in my own sweat as I paced around the airport trying to figure out what in the world I was doing and where in the world I was going.</p>					
					
				<img id="left-image" src="images/travel/reviews/steph.jpg" alt="Picture with Steph" title="Nicole & Stephanie">

					<p>Within moments I had a message from Stephanie, my dear friend and dinner date (along with Cari!) for the evening. She had been in Thailand for 18 days and prior to her leaving, actually months ago, we planned to meet up if it all worked out. The stars aligned and, yay!, it all worked out. We landed within an hour of each other and headed directly to the hotel to enjoy some chilled wine and spicy curry. We swapped stories about our trips, mine just beginning and hers coming to a close, and then hunkered down for the night.</p>					
					
					<p>Thanks for the amazing evening and place to stay, ladies! And thanks for the downtown hotel rec... more on that to come after I'm leaving (I'm not trying to have weirdos following me around, hey now. I am no fool.). Love you bunches and can't wait to see you again when I come home in March.</p>
